## Step 1: Import your data
# If you haven't exited out of RStudio since importing this data last time, you can skip these steps. 
# Rerunning these code chunks won't affect your console if you want to run them just in case, though.  
# If this line causes an error, copy in the line setwd("projects/Course 7/Week 4") before it.
# Run the code below to read in the file 'hotel_bookings.csv' into a data frame: 
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")

## Step 2: Refresh Your Memory
# By now, you are pretty familiar with this data set. 
# But you can refresh your memory with the `head()` and `colnames()` functions. 
# Run two code chunks below to get at a sample of the data and also preview all the column names:
head(hotel_bookings)
colnames(hotel_bookings)

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package (optional)
# If you haven't already installed and loaded the `ggplot2` package, you will need to do that before you can use the `ggplot()` function. 
# You only have to do this once though, not every time you call `ggplot()`.
# You can also skip this step if you haven't closed your RStudio account since doing the last activity. 
# If you aren't sure, you can run the code chunk and hit 'cancel' if the warning message pops up telling you that have already downloaded the `ggplot2` package.
# Run the code chunk below to install and load `ggplot2`. This may take a few minutes!
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)

## Step 4: Making many different charts
# Earlier, you created a scatterplot to explore the relationship between booking lead time and guests traveling with children. 
# As a refresher, here's the code:
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))

# Your stakeholder asked about the group of guests who typically make early bookings, and this plot showed that many of these guests do not have children. 
# Now, your stakeholder wants to run a family-friendly promotion targeting key market segments. 
# She wants to know which market segments generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made (city hotels or resort hotels). 
# First, you decide to create a bar chart showing each hotel type and market segment. 
# You use different colors to represent each market segment: 
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel, fill = market_segment))

# The geom_bar() function uses bars to create a bar chart. 
# The chart has 'hotel' on the x-axis and 'count' on the y-axis (note: if you don't specify a variable for the y-axis, the code defaults to 'count'). 
# The code maps the 'fill' aesthetic to the variable 'market_segment' to generate color-coded sections inside each bar.  
# After creating this bar chart, you realize that it's difficult to compare the size of the market segments at the top of the bars. 
# You want your stakeholder to be able to clearly compare each segment.   
# You decide to use the facet_wrap() function to create a separate plot for each market segment. 
# In the parentheses of the facet_wrap() function, add the variable 'market_segment' after the tilde symbol (~):
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel)) +
  facet_wrap(~market_segment)

# Now you have a separate bar chart for each market segment. Your stakeholder has a clearer idea of the size of each market segment, as well as the corresponding data for each hotel type.

## Step 5: Filtering
# For the next step, you will need to have the `tidyverse` package installed and loaded. 
# You may see a pop-up asking if you want to install; if that's the case, click 'Install.' This may take a few minutes!
# If you have already done this because you're using the `tidyverse` package on your own, you can skip this code chunk.
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)


# After considering all the data, your stakeholder decides to send the promotion to families that make online bookings for city hotels. 
# The online segment is the fastest growing segment, and families tend to spend more at city hotels than other types of guests. 
# Your stakeholder asks if you can create a plot that shows the relationship between lead time and guests traveling with children for online bookings at city hotels. This will give her a better idea of the specific timing for the promotion. 
# You think about it, and realize you have all the tools you need to fulfill the request. You break it down into the following two steps: 1) filtering your data; 2) plotting your filtered data. 
# For the first step, you can use the `filter()` function to create a data set that only includes the data you want. 
# 。Input 'City Hotel' in the first set of quotation marks and 'Online TA' in the second set of quotations marks to specify your criteria: 

onlineta_city_hotels <- filter(hotel_bookings, 
                           (hotel=="City Hotel" & 
                             hotel_bookings$market_segment=="Online TA"))


# Note that you can use the '&' character to demonstrate that you want two different conditions to be true. 
# Also, you can use the '$' character to specify which column in the data frame 'hotel_bookings' you are referencing (for example, 'market_segment'). 
# You can use the`View`() function to check out your new data frame:
View(onlineta_city_hotels)

# There is also another way to do this. You can use the pipe operator (%>%) to do this in steps! 

onlineta_city_hotels_v2 <- hotel_bookings %>%
  filter(hotel=="City Hotel") %>%
  filter(market_segment=="Online TA")


# Notice how in the code chunk above, the %>% symbol is used to note the logical steps of this code. First, it starts with the name of the data frame, `onlineta_city_hotels_v2`, AND THEN it tells `R` to start with the original data frame `hotel_bookings`. Then it tells it to filter on the 'hotel' column; finally, it tells it to filter on the 'market_segment' column.
# This code chunk generates the same data frame by using the `View()` function:
View(onlineta_city_hotels_v2)


## Step 6: Use your new dataframe
# You can use either of the data frames you created above for your new plots because they are the same. 
# Using the code for your previous scatterplot, replace `variable_name` in the code chunk below with either `onlineta_city_hotels` or `onlineta_city_hotels_v2` to plot the data your stakeholder requested:
ggplot(data = onlineta_city_hotels_v2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))

# Based on your previous filter, this scatterplot shows data for online bookings for city hotels. 
# The plot reveals that bookings with children tend to have a shorter lead time, and bookings with 3 children have a significantly shorter lead time (<200 days). So, promotions targeting families can be made closer to the valid booking dates.  

## Activity Wrap Up
# Filters allow you to create different views of your data and allow you to investigate more specific relationships within your data. 
# You can practice these skills by modifying the code chunks in the rmd file, or use this code as a starting point in your own project console. 
# Now that your stakeholder has had a chance to review these plots, they are interested in adding annotations they can use to explain the data in a presentation. 
# Luckily, `ggplot2` has a function that will allow you to do just that. 
# You will learn more about `ggplot2` in the next activity!
